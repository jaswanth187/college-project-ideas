# College-project-ideas

This repository contains all the ideas that students get when there in college or the ideas that they want to implement while studying in college.

## Ideas-list

- **Smart Bus Tracker** - When i was in first year i used to miss my bus alot. to resolve this i wanted to have an application in which it tracks the exact location of the respective bus. and notify the student before few minutes of arrival of the bus at the stop.

- **Pre-Order Canteen** - This is a popular idea. generally, this problem is faced by lots of students in their college. during lunch we all know how crowded the canteen will be there won't be much space to sit and there will be lengthy line waiting infront of the counters
  for their food. the idea is overcome this waiting. basically this application will have an option to pre-order so that the canteen guy can make or meal ready. and we don't have to wait for it.

- **Campus Companion** - This idea is basically about listing out all the events and activities in single application there the student don't have to go to notice board and have a clear picture of everything that's happening in the college. and few additional features as well like attendence, marks, etc. with good UI.
