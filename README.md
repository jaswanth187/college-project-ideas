# College-project-ideas

This repository contains all the ideas that students get when they're in college or the ideas that they want to implement while studying in college.

## Ideas-list
- **Masters Guide**

- **Youtube comments analyzer**
 
- **Smart Bus Tracker** - When I was in my first year I used to miss my bus a lot. To resolve this I wanted to have an application that tracks the exact location of the respective bus. and notify the student before few minutes after the arrival of the bus at the stop.

- **Pre-Order Canteen** - This is a popular idea. generally, this problem is faced by lots of students in their college. during lunch, we all know how crowded the canteen will be there won't be much space to sit and there will be a lengthy line waiting in front of the counters
  for their food. the idea is to overcome this waiting. basically, this application will have an option to pre-order so that the canteen guy can make or meal ready. and we don't have to wait for it.

- **Campus Companion** - This idea is basically about listing out all the events and activities in a single application there the student doesn't have to go to a notice board and have a clear picture of everything that's happening in the college. and a few additional features as well like attendance, marks, etc. with good UI.
